# Test Save Files
This folder stores test gamestate files that are supposed to be converted to Stellaris .sav files for testing
## Instructions
To convert the raw gamestate file to a testable form do the following:
1. Rename the file to 'gamestate' with no extension
2. 7zip or an other compression tool to create a zip archive containing the gamestate file and optionally the meta file(by convention the extension should be .sav)
